<h2 id="changes-in-v120-2009-07-21">Changes in v1.2.0 (2009-07-21)</h2>

<p>The core data schema is introduced as the recommended default, replacing the
YAML 1.1 type library:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">false</code> strings are parsed as booleans (including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">True</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TRUE</code>); <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">yes</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">on</code>, and their negative counterparts are parsed as strings.</li>
  <li>Underlines <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_</code> cannot be used within numerical values.</li>
  <li>Octal values need a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0o</code> prefix; e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">010</code> is now parsed with the value 10 rather than 8.</li>
  <li>The binary and sexagesimal integer formats have been dropped.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!pairs</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!omap</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!set</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!timestamp</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!binary</code> types have been dropped.</li>
  <li>The merge <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;&lt;</code> and value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> special mapping keys have been removed.</li>
</ul>

<p>The other major change has been to make sure that YAML 1.2 is a valid superset of JSON.
Additionally there are some minor differences between the parsing rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The next-line <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\x85</code>, line-separator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u2028</code> and paragraph-separator <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u2029</code> characters are no longer considered line-break characters.
Within scalar values, this means that next-line characters will not be included in the white-space normalization.
Using any of these outside scalar values is likely to result in errors during parsing.
For a relatively robust solution, try replacing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\x85</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u2028</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\u2029</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\n\n</code>.</li>
  <li>Tag shorthands can no longer include any of the characters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,[]{}</code>, but can include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>.
To work around this, either fix your tag names or use verbatim tags.</li>
  <li>Anchors can no longer include any of the characters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">,[]{}</code>.</li>
  <li>Inside double-quoted strings <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\/</code> is now a valid escape for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> character.</li>
  <li>Quoted content can include practically all Unicode characters.</li>
  <li>Documents in streams are now independent of each other,
and no longer inherit preceding document directives if they do not define their own.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="changes-in-v11-2005-01-18">Changes in v1.1 (2005-01-18)</h2>

<p>A complete refactoring of the tag syntax:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%TAG</code> directive has been added, along with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!foo!</code> tag prefix shorthand notation.</li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">^</code> character no longer enables tag prefixing.</li>
  <li>The private vs. default scoping of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!</code> tag prefixes has been switched around;
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!str</code> is now a default tag while <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!bar</code> is an application-specific tag.</li>
  <li>Verbatim <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!&lt;baz&gt;</code> tag notation has been added.</li>
  <li>The formal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tag:domain,date/path</code> format for tag names has been dropped as a requirement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The formal description of the language describing the document structure was
completely refactored, while not changing its intent. Other changes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> escape has been added for the tab character, in addition to the pre-existing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\t</code></li>
  <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\^</code> escape has been removed</li>
  <li>Directives now use a blank space <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' '</code> rather than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:</code> as the separator
between the name and its parameter/value.</li>
</ul>
