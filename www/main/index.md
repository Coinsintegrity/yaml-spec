YAML Specification Development
==============================

This site publishes the works in progress of the YAML Specification source code
[repository](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-spec), where the specification and
some related projects are actively being worked on.

The contents of this site are constantly changing and should not ever be
referenced permanently.

* [YAML Spec Revision 1.3.0](spec/1.3.0)
* [YAML Spec Revision 1.2.2](spec/1.2.2)
  * [Compare to Revision 1.2.1](review)
* [YAML Interactive Playground](playground)

<!-- * [YAML Developers Documentation](doc)
* [YAML Development Stories](story) -->

Since the repository has many active branches, we publish each branch as a
subdirectory.
For example the contents of the `main` branch are published to
<https://yaml.spec.io/main/>.
