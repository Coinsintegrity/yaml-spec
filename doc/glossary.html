<h1 id="yaml-glossary">YAML Glossary</h1>

<p>The YAML language has its own vocabulary.
It is important to use the correct words when developers discuss YAML topics.
For example the words: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">list</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">array</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sequence</code> seem like they are the
same thing and can be used interchangably, but in YAML they have different
meanings.</p>

<h2 id="a">A</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Alias</p>

    <p>An alias is a reference to another YAML node.
It similar to a pointer in the C programming language.
The alias <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*foo</code> is a reference to a node with an anchor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;foo</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Anchor</p>

    <p>An anchor is a label attached to a node.
The node can be used elsewhere by referencing it with an alias.
A node with the anchor <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;foo</code> can be referenced elsewhere with the alias
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*foo</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Application</p>

    <p>An end user program using a YAML framework.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Array</p>

    <p>The word array is sometimes used to refer to a native data structure
typically constructed from a sequence node.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="c">C</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Comment</p>

    <p>Text in a YAML file that is typically intended for humans to read, but not
considered part of the YAML data model.
Comment text may be discarded entirely by a parser.
It may also be reported as events and stored in the DOM or possibly in a
native data structure.
Syntactically, comments are text starting with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> character and continuing
to the end of the line.</p>

    <p>Comments may be used within YAML documents or before/between/after them (in
the YAML stream).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="d">D</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Directive</p>

    <p>A directive is an instruction to the parser.
YAML 1.2 defines 2 directives: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%YAML ...</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%TAG ...</code>.
Directives are part of a YAML stream, but not part of YAML documents or the
YAML data model.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Document</p>

    <p>A document is a top level YAML node.
Most YAML files consist of a single YAML document, although they may also
have zero or multiple documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>DOM</p>

    <p>A DOM is an information state that is a tree of created by a composer or a
representer and consumed by a constructor or a serializer.
A DOM may also be consumed directly by an application.
A DOM API can offer a lot more information and processing options than a
native data structure.</p>

    <p>Frameworks do not need to implement a DOM as part of their stacks, as long as
they adhere to the YAML specification rules for moving information through
the DOM.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dumper / Dump</p>

    <p>A dumper is a processor that links all the processors of a dump stack, taking
information all the way from native to file states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dump Stack</p>

    <p>The set of processors that move YAML information from</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="e">E</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Event</p>

    <p>An event is an information state produced by a parser or serializer and
consumed by a composer or emitter.
Event types include:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>stream-start</li>
      <li>stream-end</li>
      <li>document-start</li>
      <li>document-end</li>
      <li>mapping-start</li>
      <li>mapping-end</li>
      <li>sequence-start</li>
      <li>sequence-end</li>
      <li>scalar-value</li>
      <li>alias-name</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="f">F</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Framework / YAML Framework</p>

    <p>A full YAML processing implementation in a given programming language.
A framework almost always has at least a Loader and a Dumper.
A complete, full-featured YAML framework would also support things like
schema processors, path referencing, DOM API and standard library support,
among many other details.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="h">H</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Hash</p>

    <p>The word hash is sometimes used to refer to a native data structure typically
constructed from a mapping node.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="i">I</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Information</p>

    <p>Any of the various data bits flowing through a YAML stack.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="k">K</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Kind</p>

    <p>There are 3 kinds of nodes in YAML: mappings, sequences and scalars.
A kind refers to the raw structure.
A kind should not be confused with a type.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="l">L</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>List</p>

    <p>A list is a property of a type.
List types are often made from sequence nodes, but they can be result of any
tag function whose return type is a list type.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Loader / Load</p>

    <p>A dumper is a processor that links all the processors of a dump stack, taking
information all the way from native to file states.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Load Stack</p>

    <p>The set of processors that move YAML information from the file state to the
native state: read, lex, parse, compose, construct.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="m">M</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Mapping</p>

    <p>A mapping is a kind of YAML node that consists of a set of zero or more
key/value pairs.
Any kind of node is allowed to be a key, even though native models rarely
support this.
Equivalent keys (if they can be detected) are not supported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Model / Data Model</p>

    <p>This word describes elementary kinds of data that YAML represents.
A YAML file is a stream of YAML documents each of which have one root node.
Nodes may be mappings, sequences or scalars.
Nodes may be annotated with anchors and/or tags.
An alias may be used for any node.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="n">N</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Native / Native Object</p>

    <p>A language specific state that is the final result of a loader, or the
initial state given to a dumper.
This state is defined by the programming language being used, or maybe a form
crafted by the author of the application.
Some YAML frameworks may use the DOM state as their native state.</p>

    <p>As an example, in Python, generic native states include dictionaries, lists,
tuples and values.
Custom native states include the instance objects of Python classes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Node</p>

    <p>A node is an addressable point in a YAML document.
Mappings, sequences, scalars are nodes.
An alias is a reference to a node.
Anchors and tags are annotations to nodes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="p">P</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Parser / Parse</p>

    <p>A parser is processor in the load stack that reads tokens, matches them
against a grammar and write events.
It make also throw an error if the tokens don’t match the grammar.
The events are usually consumed by the composer to create a DOM, but they
might also be processed directly by a streaming application.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Processor</p>

    <p>A component in the load stack or dump stack to transforms data from one state
to another.
Load stack processors include: reader, lexer, parser, composer and
constructor.
Dump stack processors include: representer, serializer, emitter, streamer and
writer.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="r">R</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Reader / Read</p>

    <p>A reader is a processor in the load stack that reads a file and produces a
stream of unicode characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reference</p>

    <p>A reference can be thought of as a pointer to another node in the DOM.
In YAML 1.2 the onbly references are aliases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="s">S</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Scalar</p>

    <p>A scalar is a a leaf node that contains exactly one value.
Strings, numbers and booean values are examples of scalars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Schema</p>

    <p>Schema in YAML refers to all the external information required to process a
YAML information.
Unlike traditional schemas which typically enforce the structural typing of
information, a YAML schema can alter the semantic meaning of a YAML file.</p>

    <p>In YAML 1.2, schemas are almost always expressed in the source code of the
framework.
In future versions, a YAML Schema language can be used to control the
behavior of a framework (if the framework supports it).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sequence</p>

    <p>A sequence is a collection node that consists of zero or more nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stack / YAML Stack</p>

    <p>YAML processing occurs as 2 stacks of processors, each moving data (in
opposite directions) between YAML formatted text and computer memory states.
They are called the load stack and the dump stack.
Collectively the 2 stacks may be referred to as “the YAML stack”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>State</p>

    <p>A form that YAML information is in during various stages of the stack.
States include: files, characters, tokens, events, doms and native objects.
For instance an “event” is a data state produced by a parser or a serializer,
and consumed by a composer or an emitter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stream (Character Stream)</p>

    <p>The set of unicode characters produced by a reader or streamer and consumed
by a lexer or writer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stream (YAML Stream or Document Stream)</p>

    <p>A YAML file is considered a “stream” of zero or more documents.
A stream may also have directives and/or comments before, between or after
the documents.
This is the typical meaning when the word “stream” is used with no qualifier.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="t">T</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Tag</p>

    <p>A tag is an annotation on a node.
Tags are identifers preceded by a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code>, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!foo</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!!str</code>.
A tag identifier is used to identify a function that will be applied to a
node when it is retrieved from the DOM.
The function’s return type is can be considered the “type” of the node.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type</p>

    <p>A type is a set of constraints on a node.
Types are defined by schemas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="y">Y</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>YAML</p>

    <p>YAML is a programming-language-agnostic data serialization language.
“YAML” rhymes with “camel”.
YAML is a recursive backronym that stands for “YAML Ain’t Markup Language”.
People often think YAML is Yet Another Markup Language, but it Ain’t!</p>
