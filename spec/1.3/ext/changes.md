# YAML Specification Changes

The current version of the YAML language is **1.2** and the current YAML
specification revision is **1.2.2**.


## Changes in revision 1.2.2 (2021-10-01)

* Hosted the YAML specification sources in a publicly accessible
  repository[^repo].
* Changed the source format from DocBook to Markdown in hopes of lowering the
  bar to entry for public contribution. Special processing lets us keep almost
  all the fancy things that were done by DocBook.
* GNU make based system defaults to Docker containers for all processes where
  dependencies are not installed locally.
* Hundreds of change commits[^commits] submitted, reviewed and team approved as
  a GitHub pull request[^pulls].
* Corrected known errata from the previous specification.
* Addressed many reported issues[^issues].
* Clarified wording and examples.
* Fixed all broken external links.
* Images are now all generated from simple LaTeX files into SVG, requiring no
  proprietary drawing software.
* Removed sentences that are no longer relevant in 2021.
* Reworked many of the grammar productions to be clearer and not rely on
  instructional comments.
* The names and numbers of all productions remain the same.
* Added links to companion pages that can continually be updated with useful
  information that doesn't fit into the spec or that would otherwise need to
  wait until the next revision.
* Added footnote style links for links to external pages.
* Included all older specs in the spec repo and converted the www.yaml.org
  build system to get spec pages from the yaml-spec repository.
* Added new YAML logo favicon.
* Added a test system to check formatting and spellng in Markdown files,
  general linting and also checking the build systems are working properly.

## Changes in version 1.2 (revision 1.2.0) (2009-07-21)

The most significant difference between YAML 1.1 and YAML 1.2 is the
introduction of the core data schema as the recommended default, replacing the
YAML 1.1 type library.

* Only `true` and `false` strings are parsed as booleans (including `True` and
  `TRUE`); `y`, `yes`, `on`, and their negative counterparts are parsed as
  strings.
* Underlines `_` cannot be used within numerical values.
* Octal values need a `0o` prefix; e.g. `010` is now parsed with the value 10
  rather than 8.
* The binary and sexagesimal integer formats have been dropped.
* The `!!pairs`, `!!omap`, `!!set`, `!!timestamp` and `!!binary` types have
  been dropped.
* The merge `<<` and value `=` special mapping keys have been removed.

The other major change has been to make sure that YAML 1.2 is a valid superset
of JSON.
Additionally there are some minor differences between the parsing rules:

* The next-line `\x85`, line-separator `\u2028` and paragraph-separator
  `\u2029` characters are no longer considered line-break characters. Within
  scalar values, this means that next-line characters will not be included in
  the white-space normalization. Using any of these outside scalar values is
  likely to result in errors during parsing. For a relatively robust solution,
  try replacing `\x85` and `\u2028` with `\n` and `\u2029` with `\n\n`.
* Tag shorthands can no longer include any of the characters `,[]{}`, but can
  include `#`. To work around this, either fix your tag names or use verbatim
  tags.
* Anchors can no longer include any of the characters `,[]{}`.
* Inside double-quoted strings `\/` is now a valid escape for the `/`
  character.
* No space is required after the colon in flow style if the key is quoted, e.g.
  `{"key":value}`.
* The maximum key length of 1024 characters has been removed for flow mapping
  keys.
* Quoted content can include practically all Unicode characters.
* Documents in streams are now independent of each other, and no longer inherit
  preceding document directives if they do not define their own.
* Explicit document-end marker is now always required before a directive.

## Changes in version 1.1 (2005-01-18)

The most significant difference between these versions is the complete
refactoring of the tag syntax.

* The `%TAG` directive has been added, along with the `!foo!` tag prefix
  shorthand notation.
* The `^` character no longer enables tag prefixing.
* The private vs. default scoping of `!` and `!!` tag prefixes has been
  switched around; `!!str` is now a default tag while `!bar` is an
  application-specific tag.
* Verbatim `!<baz>` tag notation has been added.
* The formal `tag:domain,date/path` format for tag names has been dropped as a
  requirement.

Additionally, the formal description of the language describing the document
structure has been completely refactored between these versions, but the
described intent has not changed.
Other changes include:

* A `\` escape has been added for the tab character, in addition to the
  pre-existing `\t`.
* The `\^` escape has been removed.
* Directives now use a blank space `' '` rather than `:` as the separator
  between the name and its parameter/value.
