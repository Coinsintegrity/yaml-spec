# YAML External Resources

This page contains links to useful information for YAML users and framework
developers.
It will be continually updated over time.

## The YAML Community

The YAML Community consists of its users (in day-to-day programming tasks and
also as part of larger software projects), the implementers of YAML frameworks
and YAML tools and the core [YAML development team](team).

It should be noted that as of the time of the 1.2.2 spec revision, the YAML
specification and reference projects are once again under active development.
To find out how you can help, reach out to us via the resources listed below
and also checkout our YAML Specification Contribution Guidelines[^contributing]
page.


### YAML Community Resources

* [YAML GitHub Organization](https://github.com/yaml/)

  The YAML specification and and other core YAML projects can all be found on
  GitHub under the `yaml` organization.
  This is the place to get the source code, report or fix bugs, and discuss
  YAML topics publicly.

* [Matrix Chat](https://matrix.to/#/#chat:yaml.io)

  This is currently the most active space to engage with the YAML community in
  real time.
  Matrix (specifically the [Element](https://element.io/) client) provides a
  very modern chat-room environment for phone and desktop.
  Matrix is open source, federated and end-to-end encrypted.

* [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?channels#yaml)

  The `#yaml` channel on the libera.chat network is a long-running place where
  YAML developers hang out and field user queries from time to time.

* [Twitter YAML News](https://twitter.com/yamlnews)

  Follow us here to keep on the latest happenings in the life of YAML.

* [Mailing List](https://sourceforge.net/projects/yaml/lists/yaml-core)

  YAML was originally designed by its creators almost entirely on this mailing
  list.
  These days the mailing list is really only used for major announcements.


## YAML Web Sites

* <https://yaml.org>

  This is the original web site where you can find the YAML Specifications and
  links to popular YAML frameworks and related projects.
  The front page is written as valid YAML!

* <https://yaml.com>

  This site contains a YAML blog and the user and implementer YAML docs.
  The YAML specifications and RFCs are also published here.

* <https://yaml.io>

  This is the site where the YAML language and related tools are developed.
  It has interactive playgrounds for testing and interacting with new YAML
  projects.

* <https://www.yaml.info/>

  This web site offers various useful information for learning about YAML.
